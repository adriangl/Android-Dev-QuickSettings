# Dev-QuickSettings
## What is this?
Android Quick Settings Tiles for Android development written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

![Main image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriangl/Android-Dev-QuickSettings/master/graphics/screenshots/en-US_main.png)

The app is based on the work of [Nick Butcher](https://github.com/nickbutcher) and his [Animator Duration Quick Settings Tile](https://github.com/nickbutcher/AnimatorDurationTile) which I borrowed for the animation duration tile.

### Requirements
* An Android device, obviously :)
* Android 7.0 (Nougat) or greater, API 24+

### Current features
The app provides a few Quick Settings tiles that act as shortcut to Development Options in the Android device:
* USB Debugging
* Demo mode
* Keep screen on
* Animator duration scale
* Show taps on screen
* Destroy activities

## Where can I get it?
You can get it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adriangl.devquicksettings) or you can download the APK file from the [Releases](https://github.com/adriangl/Android-Dev-QuickSettings/releases) page.
